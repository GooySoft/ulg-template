## Subix ULauncher: https://subix.com/ul

A game template for the Subix ULauncher to get started.

## Getting Started

  #### Version File 
   * The Version file is just there to help the ULauncher, if the game has been updated.
   * Edit the Version file like that: 0.0.1 or 0.0.2 for the next updated (it just need to increase)
  
  #### Repo
   * The Repo needs to be private, otherwise people can access the game without the permission.
   * Generate an access key to let the ULauncher permission to access the game, version and keys files.
  
  #### What On The World Is ULauncher?
   * ULauncher stands for Universal Launcher means you can have multiple games in one Launcher, it's good for indie games because it has a simple key system to unlock the game and it's simple to use. AND FREE!

  #### Patreon
   * To get source files without Passwords for decrypting and other security stuff, you can help me to keep the updating the ULauncher.

  #### Downsides
   * It's has no system to let the user buy the game inside the launcher, you can only generate keys via admin mode to sell them on your website, BUT the money is ALL yours. :)
